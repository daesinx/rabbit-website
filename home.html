  <h1>Opening the Hutch</h1>
  <p>When you think of a pet rabbit, what pops into your head? Maybe a cute little bunny sitting in a tiny hutch (most commercially available hutches offer a fraction of the space rabbits need), munching on a carrot (which contains high levels of sugar and should only be fed sparingly in very small portions.) The truth is that rabbits are complex, intelligent animals with complex needs that are sadly all too often overlooked. I've created this page in an attempt to crack down on the misinformation surrounding rabbits and to help people give their pets happy, fulfilling lives.</p>

  <h1>A Brief History</h1>
  <p>To begin, let's go back in time and take a look at the beginning of our relationship with these unique animals. Rabbits were originally hunted for their meat and fur, like most cute, fluffy animals. Then one day some smart person said, "Hey, instead of chasing these little critters around the forest and setting traps, why don't we catch a bunch and breed them?" and so hunting and trapping evolved into captive breeding. Some time after that, an even smarter person thought, "Hey, these little guys are pretty cute. Instead of raising them to kill, why don't we just keep them because they're cute? Maybe I'll even try breeding them for cuteness instead of meatiness!" (This resulted in some absurdly cute breeds such as the Netherland dwarf or Holland lop.)</p>

<h1>Common Misconceptions</h1>
<ol>
<li>Rabbits make good pets for kids.</li>
<li>Rabbits can be kept in a hutch or a cage.</li>
<li>Rabbits can live alone.</li>
</ol>

<h1>"Rabbits make good pets for kids."</h1>
<p>They might look like cute little plush toys but lookscan be very deceiving. As strong as the urge might be to grab a bunny and give it a cuddle, it's important to remember that they are very delicate prey animals- and more importantl, prey animals. If you go straight in and grab a rabbit, it's prey instinct-driven brain will immediately begin to shout, "THIS IS IT, THIS IS THE END, I'M DONE FOR!"<br>
A situation like this will send the poor little guy into fight or flight, so don't act all surprised Pikachu when the rabbit gives a good old kick and scratch, or maybe even a bit with those big old staple gun incisors.<br><br>
Lack of cuddles aside, anyone with a small child in their life knows how quickly the novelty of a once coveted toy wears off, so it won't take a whole lot longer for a child to lose interest in a rabbit, especially when they realise that rabbit is less than interested in having a tea party or being dressed up in doll clothes.<br>
With the right care rabbits can live for a good ten years or more- that's potentially a decade of cleaning up poo, buying hay and food, preparing fresh vegetables daily and oughing up for routine checkups and emergency veterinary care. Rabbits also have acute hearing and sensitive ears which don't mesh very well with children's tendencies to scream and squeal.</p>

<h1>"Rabbits can be kept in a hutch or a cage."</h1>
<p>Sure, you can keep a rabbit in a cage, but don't expect them to like it! Wild rabbits spend their days grazing in open pastures or rustling through forests. They are capable of leaping over three feet up into the air and several feet vertically in a single jump. Provided enough space, a domesticated rabbit will replicate this behaviour in an adorable little move called a 'binky.' If your rabbit does this it's a clear indication that they feel happy and secure in their surroundings and is a quite literal 'jump for joy!'<br><br>
The optimum living space for a rabbit is free-roam of a room or even the whole house as long as it has been 'rabbit-proofed'. Wires should be protected and/or hidden, escape routes blocked and houseplants completely out of reach. Remember how high they can jump! You'll also want to remove or cover up anything that is a potential chewing hazard.<br>
Failing that, you'll want to invest in the biggest possible pen for living space. If you don't have the space for this, or are unwilling or unable to rabbit proof your house then it may be a good idea to reconsider if a rabbit is the right pet for you and your lifestyle.</p>

<h1>"Rabbits can live alone."</h1>
<p>You might come across the occasional oddball that has been repeatedly unsuccessful at bonding with another rabbits but the vast majority will be miserable anmd depressed if kept alone. Wild rabbits live in groups that can contain up to 30 individuals so it won't come as a surprise to learn that tey are extremely social animals.<br>
The best setup is to keep a pair of neutered rabbits together (unneutered rabbits will fight) though larger groups of rabbits can and do live quite happily together.<br>
You can keep two males, two females, or one of each sex but it is extremely important that all rabbits are desexed and fully healed before any introduction happen.<br>
Once properly bonded, a pair or group of neutered rabbits will become inseperable from one another.</p>
