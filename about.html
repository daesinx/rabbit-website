  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>From a young age, I've always had pet rabbits. My very first rabbit, Flopsy*, was bought as a 6th birthday present for me and though my parents meant well he didn't live the best life. We kept him in a hutch in the garden and lack of socialisation meant that he was fearful of being handled. Since Flopsy, I've had several more rabbits and along the way I discovered the true nature of these adorable little creatures. Each one has left a little bunny footprint on my heart. I now have three little house bunnies that are the apple of my eye. I created this website to help teach others how to give  their rabbits the happiest, healathiest lives possible.</p>
